essential for collaborating with us.

### 2. Get invited and accept

```

*You can also create a branch right in GitHubâ€™s web editor when editing files.*

want, do it straight from GitHubâ€™s web interface: click **Add file** â†’ **Upload
files** â†’ select your photo â†’ **Commit changes**.

### 6. Edit `group_members.html` and add your info

Open the file `group_members.html` and find this template block:

```html
            <!-- SEU NOME COMPLETO -->
            <div class="member-card">
              <div class="member-photo">
                <img src="./images/team-fotos/SUA_FOTO_AQUI" alt="SEU NOME COMPLETO">
              </div>
              <div class="member-info">
                <h3>SEU NOME COMPLETO</h3>
                <p class="member-position">Undergraduate Student</p>
                <p class="member-details">Computer Engineering</p>
                <div class="member-links">
                  <a href="https://github.com/SEU_GITHUB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="member-link">

                </div>
              </div>
